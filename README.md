# AutoHotKey-NumberPad-Scripts
get more functionality of that numberpad you rarely use
Add .ahk files to your Startup Folder to automatically run on startup Location: C:\Users\"user"\%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. The appdata folder is hidden by default an alternative is Win+R and searching "shell:startup" this will open the Startup Folder.
I included an "Empty" script that will type the name of the button you press on your numberpad incase you want to make your own I saved you some steps.
I also included my personal startup script which includes some increased functionality for my use incuding

-Shortcuts for Snipping Tool, and GEForce ShadowPlay for quick screen recording and capturing. 
-Swapping functionality for Alt and LWin keys (they where in the wrong spot on my keyboard)
-Quick run .exe commands for
    -Notepad++
    -MSI Afterburner
    -GeForce ShadowPlay
    -Calculator
    -File Explorer
    -Task Manager
-PrintScreen Btn now opens Paint and pastes the content of the screen in Paint


Try AHK for yourself you will find so much functionality and usability out of the simple application
